This repository contains codes for CanSat'22 Project by NASA where we build a satellite that was launched from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, US. This repo contains a GUI (Software directory) that is capable of plotting real-time data which it receives from the Satellite during lauch at the Ground Control Station (GCS). Moreover, Arduino codes for the Embedded Systems are present in Electronics directory.<br>
