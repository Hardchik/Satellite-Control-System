# Kalam-2022-GCS
This repository contains codes for International Space Challenge'22 Project where we build a satellite. This repo contains a GUI (Software directory) that is capable of plotting real-time data which it receives from the Satellite during launch at the Ground Control Station (GCS). Moreover, Arduino codes for the Embedded Systems are present in Electronics directory.<br>
